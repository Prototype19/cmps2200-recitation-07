$W(n) \in O(n+m)$ 

As shown in lectures.

- **4)**

In the worse case, and in all other cases, the number of time that the reachable function will be called is one as the number of times its called is not dependent on the size of the input graph.

- **5)**

$W(n) \in O(2n+m)$

Because the work of the reachable function is $O(n+m)$ and the work of geting all of the keys of the dictionary and turning said list into a set is $O(n)$ so the sum of these two works, since run sequenitally after each other, is $O(2n+m)$

- **7)**
